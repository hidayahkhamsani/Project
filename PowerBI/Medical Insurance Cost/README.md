### Purpose Dashboard of Medical Insurance Cost

This project aims to assist the management team of a medical insurance company and insurance brokers by providing informative visualizations through Power BI.

The visualization outcomes empower decision-making processes within the medical insurance company, enabling better healthcare management and customer service. Moreover, for insurance brokers and agents, this dashboard is a valuable tool for promoting tailored services to clients and facilitating informed decisions regarding healthcare coverage.
